===========

The Vapor Arcade is a game system emulator and ROM management system. 
What is a game system emulator?
    An emulator mimics the functionality of a hardware/software implementation of a game system. 
What is a ROM? 
    A ROM is defined as read only memory, this memory is made into a file, that file is a binary interpretation of the physical game media. A ROM is interpreted by an emulator.
